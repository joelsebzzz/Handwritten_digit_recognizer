This project is a Python-based system that recognizes handwritten digits using a pre-trained deep learning model. The system takes images of handwritten digits, processes them, and predicts the corresponding digit with high accuracy.

Features
Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for digit recognition.
Supports grayscale image inputs.
Provides real-time predictions with visual outputs.
Simple and easy-to-use interface.

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.8 or higher
TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
